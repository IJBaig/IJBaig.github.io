# ⚙️ Low-Level Engineering

[⬅️ Back to Home](./index.md)

To truly defend a system, you have to understand exactly how it operates at the lowest levels. My engineering projects focus on operating system design, memory management, and writing raw assembly code to build a deep foundation for advanced malware analysis and reverse engineering.

## 💻 InjectByte OS
* **Tech Stack:** C, x86 Assembly
* **Overview:** Engineered a custom, multithreaded operating system kernel completely from scratch.

**Core Achievements:**
* Handled low-level memory management and hardware interfacing directly.
* Implemented threading concepts and context switching without relying on existing OS libraries.
* Designed the core architecture, gaining an intimate understanding of how operating systems handle processes, interrupts, and system calls.

**Security Application:** This deep dive into OS architecture provides a massive advantage for my core goal of becoming a Malware Analyst. Understanding how a kernel handles memory and threads makes it much easier to detect rootkits, analyze process injection techniques, and reverse-engineer sophisticated malware.

## 🧮 x86 Assembly GPA Calculator
* **Tech Stack:** MASM / TASM (x86 Assembly)
* **Overview:** Developed a command-line tool entirely in assembly language to calculate Grade Point Averages.

**Core Achievements:**
* Built robust input validation directly at the assembly level to handle user data securely.
* Managed CPU registers and memory addressing manually to process calculations.
* Formatted the console output using low-level system interrupts.

**Security Application:** Writing practical applications in pure assembly strengthens my ability to read disassembled code, a fundamental skill for static malware analysis and vulnerability research.
