# 🌐 Network Architecture

[⬅️ Back to Home](./index.md)

A strong SOC Analyst must deeply understand the networks they are defending. To solidify my networking fundamentals, I design and configure enterprise-grade infrastructure simulations to understand traffic flow, segmentation, and security boundaries.

## 🏢 Enterprise Network Simulation
* **Tech Stack:** Cisco Packet Tracer, Cisco IOS
* **Overview:** Designed, subnetted, and configured a comprehensive enterprise network architecture from the ground up.

**Core Configurations:**
* **Routing & Switching:** Implemented OSPF for dynamic routing and configured complex VLAN architectures to segment departmental traffic.
* **Core Services:** Set up and managed essential network services including DHCP for dynamic IP allocation and DNS for resolution.
* **Security & Access Control:** Applied NAT to obscure internal IP addresses and strictly enforced Access Control Lists (ACLs) to manage traffic flow and secure boundaries.
* **Subnetting & IoT:** Calculated CIDR subnetting to efficiently allocate IP space and securely integrated isolated IoT devices into the network environment.

**Security Application:** Building out these environments provides a hands-on understanding of how lateral movement is facilitated (or blocked via VLANs/ACLs) by attackers, and exactly where to place IDS/IPS sensors for maximum visibility in a SOC environment.
