# 🐍 Custom Tooling & Scripting

[⬅️ Back to Home](./index.md)

Relying solely on off-the-shelf tools isn't always enough in a SOC environment. I build custom scripts and applications to automate defensive tasks, analyze network traffic, and understand core operating system mechanics.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Python Network Sniffer (Scapy)
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Scapy
* **Overview:** Developed a custom network sniffer program to capture and analyze live network traffic for forensics and troubleshooting.

**Key Features:**
* Utilizes the Python Scapy library to intercept and inspect packets at the network layer.
* Applies custom filtering to isolate specific protocols, IP ranges, and traffic types.
* Saves captured packet data into structured logs for offline network forensics and analysis.

**Security Application:** Understanding packet structures from the ground up enhances my ability to detect anomalous network behavior, identify cleartext transmissions, and investigate potential data exfiltration without relying entirely on automated IDS alerts.

## 🏦 Banker's Algorithm Simulator
* **Tech Stack:** Python, GUI Development
* **Overview:** Built a graphical user interface (GUI) tool to simulate the Banker's Algorithm, a fundamental operating system concept for resource allocation and deadlock avoidance.

**Key Features:**
* Allows users to input dynamic resource matrices.
* Computes and outputs safe sequences to ensure the system remains in a secure, functional state.
* Simulates resource request handling to determine if granting a specific resource will lead to a system deadlock.

**Security Application:** Demonstrates a strong, practical understanding of OS-level resource management, which is critical for analyzing denial-of-service (DoS) conditions and understanding how malware might attempt to exhaust system resources.
