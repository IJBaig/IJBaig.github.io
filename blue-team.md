# 🛡️ Blue Team & Incident Response

[⬅️ Back to Home](./index.md)

My core focus is on defensive security, Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows, and practical threat detection. Below are highlights from my enterprise simulations and lab-based incident response training.

## 🏢 Enterprise Security Simulations (Forage)
I completed a series of job simulations mirroring real-world SOC and defensive security tasks for major enterprises. 

### **AIG: Threat Analysis & Mitigation**
* **Objective:** Conduct threat analysis aligned with CISA publications and mitigate active attacks.
* **Actions Taken:** * Authored structured remediation guidance for a simulated cyberattack.
  * Developed a custom Python script to mitigate key brute-force attacks in a controlled scenario.
* **Skills:** Threat Intelligence, Python Security Automation, Incident Response.

### **Mastercard: Phishing & Security Awareness**
* **Objective:** Analyze phishing threats and improve internal security posture.
* **Actions Taken:** Investigated malicious email vectors, extracted Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and developed a strategy to enhance internal security awareness.
* **Skills:** Phishing Analysis, IOC Extraction, Email Security.

### **Deloitte & Telstra: Log Analysis & Breach Investigation**
* **Objective:** Identify suspicious user behavior and handle incident response during a simulated breach.
* **Actions Taken:** Reviewed web activity logs and SIEM data to trace attacker lateral movement and identify compromised accounts.
* **Skills:** Log Analysis, SIEM, Threat Hunting.

### **Datacom & Tata Group: Risk & IAM**
* **Objective:** Conduct cyberattack investigations and apply access control principles.
* **Actions Taken:** Performed structured risk assessments and documented business-aligned cybersecurity policies focusing on Identity and Access Management (IAM).
* **Skills:** Risk Assessment, IAM, Compliance Basics.

## 🔬 Lab-Based SIEM & SOC Training

To back up my simulation work, I heavily utilize lab environments to get hands-on with industry-standard SIEMs.

* **IBM Security Operations Center in Practice:** Gained hands-on exposure to SOC workflows, alert triage, and incident handling using **IBM QRadar** and IBM X-Force Exchange.
* **Splunk Search Under the Hood:** Advanced my SPL query writing skills to better understand internal search processing, allowing for much faster log correlation and threat investigations.
* **LetsDefend SOC Analyst Path:** Covered the full detection-to-remediation lifecycle, including EDR, SOAR, registry analysis, and alert triage.
