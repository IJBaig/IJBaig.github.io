## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an Information Technology student (having completed five semesters) with a deep, hands-on focus on cybersecurity. I specialize in defensive security, SOC workflows, and practical threat detection. 

Rather than just studying theory, I build projects from scratch and complete hands-on simulations aligned with real SOC tasks. My core focus is on bridging academic concepts with lab-based platforms and enterprise simulations to hunt threats, analyze malware, and secure network infrastructure.

**Core Competencies:**
* **Security Operations:** SIEM (Splunk, IBM QRadar), Incident Response, Alert Triage.
* **Network Defense:** Packet Analysis (Scapy, Wireshark), Network Forensics, IDS/IPS.
* **Forensics & Analysis:** Static/Dynamic Malware Analysis, Windows Registry Analysis.
* **Programming:** Python (Security Automation), C, C++, x86 Assembly, SQL.
