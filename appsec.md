# 🧠 AI & Application Security

[⬅️ Back to Home](./index.md)

Modern application security requires moving beyond static rule-based detection. I explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and web security to build smarter threat detection models and understand complex web vulnerabilities.

## 🤖 XSS Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Deep Learning, CNN Architecture
* **Overview:** Developed a custom deep learning model designed specifically to identify and classify Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payload patterns.

**Core Achievements:**
* Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze web inputs and recognize malicious scripts.
* Moved beyond traditional signature-based detection to identify obfuscated or zero-day XSS variations.
* Successfully blended artificial intelligence principles with practical application security needs.

**Security Application:** As web attacks become more sophisticated, SOCs increasingly rely on AI-driven platforms. Building my own detection model gives me a fundamental understanding of how Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW) and Web Application Firewalls (WAF) process and flag malicious traffic.

## 🌐 Web Application Exploitation Mastery
To build effective detection models, I also maintain a strong understanding of how these web vulnerabilities are actively exploited.

* **Web Hacking Expert: Full Stack Exploitation (Packt):** Mastered the mechanics of critical web vulnerabilities to better defend against them. 
* **Core Vulnerabilities Covered:** SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), File Inclusion, Insecure Deserialization, and Authentication bypass attacks.
