# 🚩 CTFs & Threat Hunting

[⬅️ Back to Home](./index.md)

Continuous hands-on practice is the only way to stay sharp in a blue team role. I regularly participate in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges and complete structured defensive security paths to validate my skills against realistic attack scenarios.

## 🛡️ LetsDefend: Blue Team Training
I leverage LetsDefend to simulate a live Security Operations Center environment, investigating alerts and analyzing malicious files.

* **Malware Analysis Skill Path:** Mastered triage and IOC extraction. Conducted deep-dive static and dynamic analysis, alongside sandbox behavior reviews, to understand malware execution flows and integrate findings into SOC defenses.
* **SOC Analyst Learning Path:** Executed the full alert lifecycle from detection to remediation. Gained practical experience with EDR and SOAR platforms, Windows registry analysis, and alert triage.

## 🎯 TryHackMe: Applied Security & Forensics
I use TryHackMe to practice both offensive techniques (to understand the attacker mindset) and defensive forensics.

* **Advent of Cyber 2025:** Completed a rigorous 24-day intensive challenge covering a wide spectrum of modern security domains.
  * **Core Skills Applied:** Web application security (SSTI, IDOR, insecure APIs), AI security basics, log forensics, and deep packet analysis using Python and Scapy.
* **Network Forensics & Incident Response:** * Successfully tackled targeted rooms like **CCT2019 - pcap1**, analyzing raw packet captures to trace attacker activity and extract evidence.
  * Explored offensive methodologies in rooms like **Bounty Hacker** to better understand how to defend against enumeration and privilege escalation.
